# Contributing to Termux App Store

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Termux App Store**
This project is a **community-driven infrastructure** for building and validating Termux packages.  
We welcome contributions of all kinds, as long as they follow the standards described below.

---

## Contribution Scope

You may contribute in one or more of the following areas:

- New Termux packages (`packages/<name>`)
- Improvements to existing `build.sh`
- CI / validation logic
- CLI tooling (`termux-build`, `tasctl`)
- Documentation & guides
- Bug reports & fixes
- Feature proposals

---

## Repository Structure Overview

```text
packages/
  └── <pkg-name>/
      └── build.sh
termux-build   # Core build tool
tasctl         # CLI controller
```

---

## Contribution Principles
All contributions must follow these principles:
1. **Automation-first** – If it can be validated, it must be validated.
2. **Reproducibility** – Builds must be deterministic.
3. **Transparency** – No hidden logic or obfuscation.
4. **Community-first** – No breaking changes without discussion.

---

## Adding a New Package
1. Package Layout
```text
packages/<pkg-name>/build.sh
```
or auto create build package
```text
./teemux-build create <pkg-name>
```
2. build.sh Requirements
- Must follow Termux packaging standards
- Must define:
 - TERMUX_PKG_HOMEPAGE
 - TERMUX_PKG_DESCRIPTION
 - TERMUX_PKG_LICENSE
 - TERMUX_PKG_VERSION
- Must NOT:
 - Download prebuilt binaries without verification
 - Use hardcoded paths outside $PREFIX
3. Validate Locally
```Sh
./termux-build lint <pkg-name>
./termux-build check-pr <pkg-name>
```
CI will reject PRs that fail validation.

---

## CI & Quality Gates
All pull requests are automatically checked via GitHub Actions:
- Linting packages
- Validating build.sh
- CLI behavior checks
- Python coverage enforcement
A pull request **cannot be merged** if any CI check fails.

---

## Commit Message Convention
Use clear and structured commit messages:
```text
<type>: <short description>

[optional body]
```
