# Installation Guide

This document explains how to install **Termux App Store** on Termux.

The recommended method is using the official installer script, which installs
the binary release and hides internal implementation details.

---

## Requirements

- Termux (latest version recommended)
- Internet connection
- One of the following architectures:
  - `aarch64` (recommended)
  - `armv7l`
  - `x86_64`

> No manual Python or Textual setup is required when using the binary release.

---

## Quick Install (Recommended)

> Option 1 (Recommended)

Run the following command:

```bash
pip install termux-app-store textual
```

> Option 2 (Manual)

Run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/djunekz/termux-app-store
cd termux-app-store
bash install.sh
```
or with `tasctl` in directory termux-app-store
```bash
git clone https://github.com/djunekz/termux-app-store
cd termux-app-store
./tasctl install
```
### After installation, run:
- `termux-app-store` - Open TUI
- `termux-app-store help` - Open CLI

---

## What the Installer Does
The installer will:
- Detect your CPU architecture automatically
- Download the correct binary release
- Install it into a hidden directory:
```
$HOME/.termux-app-store
```
or directory
```
$PREFIX/lib/.tas/
```
- Create a symlink:
```
$PREFIX/bin/termux-app-store
```
- Make the app runnable from anywhere
You do not need to know where the internal files are located.
---

## Binary Mode (Default)
By default, Termux App Store runs as a prebuilt binary:
- Source code is not required at runtime
- Python files are not exposed
- Prevents accidental modification
- Faster startup
This is intentional.
---

## Python Fallback Mode (Advanced)
If you are running from source (not recommended for normal users):
### Install dependencies manually
```
pkg install python -y
pip install --upgrade textual
```
### Run manually
```
cd termux-app-store
python termux-app-store.py
```
This mode is intended for developers only.

---

## Packages Directory Requirement
Termux App Store requires a packages/ directory inside the project root.
### Structure example:
```Text
termux-app-store/
├── packages/
│   ├── package1/
│   │   └── build.sh
│   └── package2/
│       └── build.sh
└── build-package.sh
```
The app will automatically locate this directory even if the project folder is moved or renamed.

---

## Troubleshooting
### command not found: termux-app-store
Restart Termux or run:
```Bash
hash -r
```
### Unsupported architecture
If you see:
```Text

```Bash

```
